  <h2 class="heading">3. The Maya Ruins</h2>
  <p class="text">At the height of the Mayan Empire, large cities were built in what is now Belize that housed
    hundred of thousands of people. The Maya used the Belize River as a "super highway" to transport
    good throughout the country and connect with the big city-states in Guatemala.<br><br> 
    In addition to the well-excavated ruins such as Xunantunich and Caracol pictured above, there are many 
    other large cities that are still awaiting exploration in the jungles and rainforests.<br><br>
    Today, many ethnic Maya continue to live in Belize, particularly in the southern parts of the country.</p>

    nurse sharks, giant groupers, and several types of reef sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark and the Blacktip shark. <br><br>Dive excursions to the Great Blue Hole are full-day trips that usually consist of one dive in the 
    Blue Hole and two additional dives in nearby reefs.</p>
