    <p class="text">Belize has a rich history dating back to the ancient Maya. Initially
      called British Honduras, it was colonized by the United Kingdom in the 17th century 
      and remained a British colony until 1981.</p>
    <h2 class="heading">The Maya Civilization</h2>
    <p class="text"> As the first inhabitants of Belize, the ancient Maya civilization settled in the region 
      around 1000 BC.</p>
    <p class="text">They built impressive cities and created a sophisticated society with a highly developed system
      of writing, art, mathematics, and astronomy.</p>
    <h2 class="heading">Conquest and early colonial period</h2>
    <p class="text">In the 16th century, the Spanish arrived in the region and claimed the area.
      However, the Maya fiercely resisted and the Spanish did not establish a strong presence in the 
      area.</p>
    <p class="text">The British, on the other hand, starting in the 17th century, established several settlements around
      the exploitation of foresty resources such as logwood and mahoganny.</p>
    <p class="text">As British settlements grew, the Spanish attakced several times, attempting to retain their land until
      the British ultimately defeated them in 1798 in what is known as the Battle of St. George's Caye.</p>
    <h2 class="heading">British Honduras</h2>
    <p class="text">In 1862, the area was officially recognized as a crown colony of Britain and it was named British Honduras.</p>
    <p class="text">Forestry dominated the early economy of British Honduras.</p>
    <h2 class="heading">Self-governance and Independence</h2>
    <p class="text">During the 1950s and 60s, British Honduras experienced a strong push for liberation from British governance.
      This effort resulted in the attainment of "self-government" in 1964, ultimately culminating in full 
      independence from the United Kingdom in September 21, 1981. </p>
    <p class="text">The country was officially renamed Belize in June 1973. The name is believed to have Maya origins, stemming 
      from the word "Balix," which means "muddy water" in Mayan. The connection to the region's indigenous history 
      was intended to reflect the diverse heritage and identity of the nation.</p>
